# Fourier Transform of the Symmetric Group

This repository contains a very basic program that calculates a Fourier Transform of the Symmetric Group, based on Young-Yamanuchi's representations.

One can run the program as follows:

    python3 Fourier_Transform.py <n>

If `n` is not specified, the default value of 3 is used. The program subsequently shows a Fourier Transform of the group Sn.
